# Homepage of Hai

My name is 胡(Hu) 海(Hai), but in English people say it in the reverse way, which sounds more like: Hi! Who?
 
I’m a Ph.D. student in (Computational) Linguistics at Indiana University Bloomington. 
 
Most of my research interests: Chinese linguistics, parsing, syntactic differences among different texts. See my [Publication & projects](projects/) page for more information.
